## Introduction

While `Verso` is in the early stages of development, it's beneficial to understand why it exists.

There are many browsers on the market already, no doubt. Different visions, different budgets.
It's typically a product, that users get for free... despite the fact it is one of the most important tools they use.
The gateway to the `World Wide Web`.

Although, it's only free price-wise. Users usually pay with data, thus they convert themselves to the product.
Many browsers attempt to achieve different goals, and while doing so: play various games.
We are a bit different, **we don't participate in this market competition, we don't have a play**.

## ... then what is this about?

We like to say, it's fluid. In the long run, we'd like to offer an alternative to all the competing browsers, sure.
But not the way you imagine. `Verso` is an experimental browser, and most probably it will remain as such.

If we would like to compete, then we just could make a new browser based on `Verso`, give it a new name, and go!
But instead of it, we focus on the technology.

## What's the fuss about technology?

**We love technology**. We are the kind of people, who not settling down for some "okay" solution.
We are looking for the best solutions that the situation allows, and continuously fixing up and improving everything we can.

In this very mindset, [Rust] and [Servo] were born more than a decade ago.
Both were developed in tandem, to look for new ways of making the technology scene better.
`Rust` is for ensuring memory safety and mitigating other security-critical issues,
while `Servo` is for researching new ways to have newer and better approaches for browsers.

And this is what we are doing here too: developing technology that could be a base for many other new things.
If you think about `Servo` as a web browser engine based on `Rust`,
then think about `Verso` as a web browser framework (based on `Servo`)!

**What you easily could use as a base to ship your own browser**.

### Contribution

It's still unclear what kind of contributions we are after, but any help is appreciated!
To chat with us about the projects, goals, and visions: you could join [our Zulip][zulip].

For the code, check the [GitHub repository][gh-repo]! Especially the `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Whitepapers

Sometimes, a few whitepapers could pop up.
They are usually about ideas already matured for a while and are part of some future vision.  
...but unless it's over `v1.0`, don't handle it too seriously.
